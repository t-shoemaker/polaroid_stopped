as I as you even they as a one
though through it whole
as might as even a one some
I as did still as done
one said

                                 27


this say what say
I say you they
one says it
whole saying
down the as one whiles
saying they you
it was to longs
down
I say still staying still

you
are one and they both whole
it staying says
a while down even it says
the one you
I was a while
whole as it
one's it
one's as one

last say by
about the one you saying
still
being how they as it still one
I often most part
being you as it but both
saying they're some between
by another one's I
did say very
those one means as done

                                 28

that
is of one is
what I saying still does
doing what hence there's some the same
you saying do
say it as one will
to too
not about or by beside
one's never yet once nor another

say I a while
last up to such do
you they still must
as a must you as one does still
I saying you say one says it said
the last most often parts one
of a way saying often both wills such
a one said whatever it
whole it as one you do I
say

                                   29


of
it's says it's other say
of thus whole I about doing part
it's of you one stills I then
then now so I will
say those parting ones of stills
the beside you below they
say it then of when an only thus
do same are what of that since
a part does
I yet part that way too till

you
does only they I part between
long
and then part does it one means
back
and the
part way forth kind
I
does it the you the one part
did yet this is from
were for whence not
even this stilling till start
a back as it's even then
the you I both that willing one
this be same

                                           30




as
the never you I would
stills having been one I
then of so what have this
not only ever even been
a what of a not that's
apart either both or one
it's stills tend so
you 'll at that's one only
how in such though as tend
down thus to as much I did
though as much as you as tend
of tending all of those of
what about
I

were it much you did I
the itself the there does
then of you been can it
never a much all near part
a too yet beside that
besides post

I what which you how others those
both hence there then a like I
till means yet kind all must once
though the above tend as much never will
then whole or both now willing still
the tends stills can

                                           31



about do
the just which can not
one it is it's
what part the near is
about you both I
whole about and among so like near
a like you
a some whole of what even like I
both about such will beside
how to say part
of the one longs will means of
downing
so do

they often most as either
one or I you do
does the often way to the such both will
near
parts either that or one since that's
the one I will you do it
now or then like even both like what
this of which since can it

                                 32

do not you
one is I still
not other then more like than others often
same as a like do
the one it's of same as I
like what way will both seem of
an either between yet often of
what's once most part of how much
if it often another I am both say
and you willing same tend some
not as a one tends the one before
that one you both will saying they

do
on about on the outs
or often along what this of said
a not even all of it evens
to only with much it were
were it not one such a while
not both said but nearly on said
in parts then of which thus so what then
on out has and does
it though it's
one's you

                                                    33



a not said same one
some one of the either forth or both
saying evenly a while it's
till it were from if it you
I still if even so what then
it whiles it's ones
both it does as you it says
as still as you have it as was it
while it does do it does while one once
was it once you have it
even as to even you still one both have as was it
does stay then it says you
do you one says you

one of both it let be the stays
as often one of we either likes or does
it's you that's one it is I
am of this as not a much kind more
meaning once it's still it does
you

                                 34

since this ' s
is nor is 's it's
can some as be what
are some
this is not 's
as as as as
does this as does what beside
onto other of those either how
do
be as what may some are

I do as does it did yet
for those say parting ones
as back and then the long part way
to
whole as one stills I then you now so say
saying does and long as you and I as one part
does you then now so I will
you saying thus saying stills willing not but as back one too
even then as it's a back one now
evens one
does it as one means

an out but even long one like never means forth yet must while once itself
                                                may both often and part much
I such as soon as not since do what
of what within that those hence both will
not any besides
a part from then now those
till an only that since thus stills
part that
back and
even a back as the you I both are
and this be as the same were

                                                  35


not this be as ever
down among of like both either
means that since both do to only as has does
beside a too yet how in
since though it have as if it was it
what still both one does
it whiles it ones it's says
whole as whatever it once it tends

to whole to so stay
to be what one being
for as one you both whole one
both for as means does do it
means once a while for a part the one both been
not away for and a much while whole
does for as
one for both for

this does for an ever to see for
to be such as for what must for now
then be
for whole itself itself tends as
for to see one being what must then whole one
as for a both whiles one
one's then they are too
for it's have been seen both
by does do for some as means ones
till such to as what it can it does it's

past even an out besides
it's same as even ah I than as what's
as what the one you are means does and both
then never saying they do you will
hence saying one is that of saying as one is
the last most of a one long way to

                                 36

till
as about whole a like part
as the most for the much part often
whiling stay seem
how nor another
some there though same above both either or down
one
are
part of the way both below in on or out
then onto were

being so thinking that through that one
does most part until then
since
were either those only whatever
does to as down with
these said to bent that while was come
was open was more much as would though
not so any more for as at all well any felt
not whether for a thing of

does this as it has does it
one means once a while
at till does for as one for both or
till as about whole as there some
ones are
part of then are onto were
as about till even evens does it
it's it whiles it whole
another stays often it's both it's wills to
both we I stay you
stay as one those we have it whole as

think to bolt

say that such stays to
what still both while
another some ones are
hence while it been stays it
even the one to be a whole will
